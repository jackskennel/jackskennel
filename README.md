### Undergraduate in CS + Linguistics @ UIUC.

- While I generally have interests in all things CS, my academic interests are:
  - Neural NLP in the domain of agglutinating languages -- specifically improving preexisting neural models to cope with data scarcity created by agglutination.
  - [Algorithmic fairness](https://github.com/uclanlp/awesome-fairness-papers) in the domain of NLP.
  - Mathematical statistics, generally.

#### Currently...
- I'm working with Professors [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Karle Flanagan](https://kflan.stat.illinois.edu/) as part of the [National Leadership in Data Science Education Group](https://provost.illinois.edu/about/initiatives/investment-for-growth-program/fy24-funded-programs/) to make the University of Illinois system a national leader in data science.
  - I've primarily been developing [Illinois Mastery Platform](https://mastery.cs.illinois.edu/platform/course/DISCOVERY/), an instructor-friendly and student-focused online learning and assessment platform with over 1,000 concurrent users.

#### In the past...
- (Summer 2022) I worked with Prof. [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/) on improving autograding infrastructure for UIUC's (many) programming-based courses to allow them to scale better to better fit the new demands created by the rapidly increasing size of UIUC's CS department. Specifically, I worked on leveraging GitHub Actions to create a more secure, robust, and transparent autograding pipeline for students through the development of various [open source](https://github.com/illinois/autograding) CI/CD tools designed specifically for autograding.
- (Spring 2023) I worked as lead course assistant for **[CS 340](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs340/fa2022) - Intro to Computer Systems**.
