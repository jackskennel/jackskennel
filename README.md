### Undergraduate in CS + Linguistics @ UIUC.

- I work as lead CA for **[CS 340](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs340/fa2022) - Intro to Computer Systems**. 
  - This summer, I've been working with Prof. [Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/) on improving course infrastructure to scale better to better fit the new demands created by the rapidly increasing size of UIUC's CS department. My work has primarily involved leveraging GitHub Actions to create a more secure, robust,  and transparent autograding pipeline for students through the development of various [open](https://github.com/illinois/verify-policy) and closed-source workflow tools.
- While I generally have interests in all things CS, my academic interests are:
  - Neural NLP in the domain of agglutinating languages -- specifically improving preexisting neural models to cope with data scarcity created by agglutination.
  - [Algorithmic fairness](https://github.com/uclanlp/awesome-fairness-papers) in the domain of NLP.
  - Mathematical statistics, generally.
